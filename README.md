Project files for my course
first thing do not change or edit any file only 2 file  
fisrt file src -> constants -> index.js this file contains all the info and const vars like website name and desorption teamMembers ,.... you can fill up the inf just like the examples 
the sec file src -> utils -> index.js this file is for import the imgs from the (assets -> imgs) and export them to use them in other file like  the first file you can add team imgs skills imgs logo... just like the examples
notes:
1-teamMembers and team skills sections if you don't want them just go to the src -> constants -> index.js and edit the teamMembers and skills vars and make them empty 
2- I used React+Vite framwork to build this website
